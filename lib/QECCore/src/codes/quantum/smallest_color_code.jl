The `[[8, 2, 3]]` color code, also known as the smallest interesting color code,
serves as the seed code for constructing Delfosse-Reichardt generalized `[[8p, 4p âˆ’ 2, 3]]`
codes, as described in [delfosse2020short](@cite).

The ECC Zoo has an [entry for this family](https://errorcorrectionzoo.org/c/stab_8_3_2).
