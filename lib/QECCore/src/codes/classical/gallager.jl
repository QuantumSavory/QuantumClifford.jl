Construct a regular LDPC code parity-check matrix `H` using Gallager's
original construction method [gallager1962ldpc](@cite).

# Mathematical Formulation

The parity-check matrix `H` is constructed as:

```math
\\begin{aligned}
H = \\begin{bmatrix} H_1 \\\\ H_2 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ H_{w_c} \\end{bmatrix}
\\end{aligned}
```

where each submatrix ``H_d`` is a ``μ × μw_r`` binary matrix with:
- Row weight ``w_r`` (number of 1s per row)
- Column weight 1 (each column has exactly one 1)

The first submatrix ``H_1`` has a specific structure where row ``i`` (``1 ≤ i ≤ μ``) contains 
its ``w_r`` 1s in columns ``(i-1)w_r + 1`` to ``iw_r``. Subsequent submatrices ``H_2,...,H_{w_c}`` 
are *column permutations* of ``H_1``.

The ECC Zoo has an [entry for this family](https://errorcorrectionzoo.org/c/gallager).

# Example

Here is an example of `(3,4)`-LDPC code

```jldoctest
julia> using QECCore; using Nemo

julia> μ = 3; wc = 3; wr = 4;

julia> c = GallagerLDPC(μ, wc, wr);

julia> H = parity_matrix(c)
9×12 SparseArrays.SparseMatrixCSC{Bool, Int64} with 36 stored entries:
 1  1  1  1  ⋅  ⋅  ⋅  ⋅  ⋅  ⋅  ⋅  ⋅
 ⋅  ⋅  ⋅  ⋅  1  1  1  1  ⋅  ⋅  ⋅  ⋅
 ⋅  ⋅  ⋅  ⋅  ⋅  ⋅  ⋅  ⋅  1  1  1  1

julia> code_n(c), code_k(c)
(12, 5)

julia> all(sum(Matrix(H), dims=1) .== 3)
true

julia> all(sum(Matrix(H), dims=2) .== 4)
true
