For a graph G=(VE) the corresponding stabilizers are S_v = X_v prod_u  N(v) Z_u. Notice that such tableau rows contain only a single X operator. There is a set of single qubit gates that converts any stabilizer state to a graph state.\n\nThis function returns the graph state corresponding to a stabilizer and the gates that might be necessary to convert the stabilizer into a state representable as a graph.\n\nFor a tableau stab you can convert it with:\n\ngraph, hadamard_idx, iphase_idx, flips_idx = graphstate()\n\nwhere graph is the graph representation of stab, and the rest specifies the single-qubit gates converting stab to graph: hadamard_idx are the qubits that require a Hadamard gate (mapping X ↔ Z), iphase_idx are (different) qubits that require an inverse Phase gate (Y → X), and flips_idx are the qubits that require a phase flip (Pauli Z gate), after the previous two sets of gates.\n\njulia> using Graphs\n\njulia> s = S\" XXX\n              ZZ_\n             -_ZZ\";\n\n\njulia> g, h_idx, ip_idx, z_idx = graphstate(s);\n\n\njulia> collect(edges(g))\n2-element Vector{Graphs.SimpleGraphs.SimpleEdge{Int64}}:\n Edge 1 => 2\n Edge 1 => 3\n\njulia> h_idx\n2-element Vector{Int64}:\n 2\n 3\n\njulia> ip_idx\nInt64[]\n\njulia> z_idx\n1-element Vector{Int64}:\n 3\n\nThe Graphs.jl library provides many graph-theory tools and the MakieGraphs.jl library provides plotting utilies for graphs.\n\nYou can directly call the graph constructor on a stabilizer, if you just want the graph and do not care about the Clifford operation necessary to convert an arbitrary state to a state representable as a graph:\n\njulia> collect(edges( Graph(bell()) ))\n1-element Vector{Graphs.SimpleGraphs.SimpleEdge{Int64}}:\n Edge 1 => 2\n\nFor a version that does not copy the stabilizer, but rather performs transformations in-place, use graphstate!.
