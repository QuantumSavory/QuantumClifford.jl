"""The family of Goppa codes, as discovered by Denisovich Goppa, in his 1970 paper [goppa1970new](@cite).

An irreducible binary Goppa code is characterized by two key elements:

- Goppa Polynomial `(g(x))`: A polynomial of degree `t` defined over the finite field `GF(2^m)`. This polynomial must have no repeated roots.

- Support List `(L)`: A list containing `n` distinct elements from the finite field `GF(2^m)`. These elements must not be roots of the Goppa polynomial g(x).


The sequence L plays a crucial role in defining the structure of an irreducible binary Goppa code. The steps involved in forming L are as follows:

1. Field Selection: A finite field, `GF(2^m)`, is chosen based on the extension degree `m`.
2. Goppa Polynomial: The input polynomial g(x) is used, which should be irreducible and have no repeated roots within `GF(2^m)`.
3. Elements Selection for `L`: The sequence `L` consists of `n` distinct elements chosen from `GF(2^m)`. Importantly, no element in L can be a root of g(x).

The parity-check matrix `(H)` of an irreducible binary Goppa code can be expressed as the product `(H = VD)` of two simpler matrices:

- Vandermonde Matrix `(V)`:
  - Each row of `V` is constructed using the elements from the support list `(L)` raised to different powers.

- Diagonal Matrix `(D)`:
  - Each diagonal element in D is related to the roots of the Goppa polynomial `(g(x))`.
