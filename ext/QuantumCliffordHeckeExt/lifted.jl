$TYPEDEF

Classical codes lifted over a group algebra, used for lifted product code construction ([panteleev2021degenerate](@cite), [panteleev2022asymptotically](@cite))

The parity-check matrix is constructed by applying `repr` to each element of `A`,
which is mathematically a linear map from a group algebra element to a binary matrix.
The size of the parity check matrix will enlarged with each element of `A` being inflated into a matrix.
The procedure is called a lift [panteleev2022asymptotically](@cite).

## Constructors

A lifted code can be constructed via the following approaches:

1. A matrix of group algebra elements.

2. A matrix of group elements, where a group element will be considered as a group algebra element by assigning a unit coefficient.

3. A matrix of integers, where each integer represent the shift of a cyclic permutation. The order of the cyclic permutation should be specified.

The default `GA` is the group algebra of `A[1, 1]`, the default representation `repr` is the permutation representation.

## The representation function `repr`

In this struct, we use the default representation function `default_repr` to convert a `GF(2)`-group algebra element to a binary matrix.
The default representation, provided by `Hecke`, is the permutation representation.

We also accept a custom representation function.
Such a customization would be useful to reduce the number of bits required by the code construction.

For example, if we use a D4 group for lifting, our default representation will be `8×8` permutation matrices,
where 8 is the group's order.
However, we can find a `4×4` matrix representation for the group,
e.g. by using the typical [`2×2` representation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dihedral_group)
and converting it into binary representation by replacing "1" with the Pauli I, and "-1" with the Pauli X matrix.
