"""
Checks the commutation relation between the left and right representation matrices
for two elements `a` and `b` in the group algebra `ℱ[G]` with a general group `G`.
It verifies the commutation relation that states, `L(a)·R(b) = R(b)·L(a)`. This
property shows that matrices from the left and right representation sets commute
with each other, which is an important property related to the CSS orthogonality
condition.
