# [Classification of Stabilizer Simulators](@id classification_of_stabilizer_simulators)

Brute-force simulation algorithms, such as *Schr√∂dinger-style* ([fatima2021faster](@cite)), *Feynman-style*
([de2019massively](@cite), [markov2008simulating](@cite), [de2007massively](@cite)), and *hybrid* simulators
([markov2018quantum](@cite)) provide high precision for simulating *universal* quantum circuits, but
they can become highly resource-intensive for circuits with moderate width (around *40* qubits) or depth.
Alternatively, efficiently classically simulable quantum circuits, like stabilizer circuits, can be
simulated using the *Gottesman-Knill* theorem, allowing the simulation of thousands of qubits with hundreds
of thousands of gates. Research to overcome the limitations of these methods falls into two main categories:
*Born rule probability estimators* that use a quasi-probabilistic representation of the density matrix, and
*pure-state sampling simulators*.

### Aaronson and Gottesman's Simulator

- Introduced in *Improved Simulation of Stabilizer Circuits* [aaronson2004improved](@cite)
- **Efficient for Stabilizer Circuits**: Introduced a classical simulation algorithm efficient
for stabilizer circuits.
- **Simulates Non-Stabilizer Circuits**: Handles non-stabilizer circuits with **exponential**
run-time cost depending on the number of non-stabilizer gates.
- **Limitation**: The run-time does not depend on the specific properties of the additional
non-stabilizer gates, incurring a heavy penalty even for small deviations from stabilizer gates.

  - Decomposes density matrices into stabilizer *dyads* ``|L\rangle\langle R|``.
  - Circuits promoted to universality using magic states.

#### **Run-Time**:

- Depends quadratically on the dyadic negativity.
- Dyadic negativity measures deviation from convex combinations of stabilizer dyads.

### Bravyi and Gosset Algorithms

- **BG-Estimation Algorithm**: Produces multiplicative precision estimates of Born rule probabilities.
- **BG-Sampling Algorithm**: Samples approximately from the quantum circuit outcome distribution.

#### **Methodology**:

- **State Representation**: Initial states are expressed as a linear combination of stabilizer states.
- **Efficiently Simulable Circuits**:
  - Superposition of polynomially many stabilizer states.
  - Clifford gates and computational basis measurements.
- **Promoting Universality**: Allowing magic states in initial conditions.

#### **Run-Time Dependence**:

- Linear in the stabilizer rank of the state.
- **Stabilizer Rank**: Minimal number of stabilizer states required to represent the state as a linear combination.
- **Approximation and Stabilizer Extent**: Approximate stabilizer rank can be bounded by the *stabilizer extent*
``\xi`` divided by ``\epsilon^2``, where ``\epsilon`` is the approximation error.

### Sum Over Cliffords Algorithm

 - Introduced in *Simulation of quantum circuits by low-rank stabilizer decompositions* ([bravyi2019simulation](@cite))
- **Variant**: Simulates non-Clifford gates using a linear combination of Clifford gates.
- **Run-Time**: Scales linearly with the stabilizer extent of states like ``|T_\phi^\dagger \rangle``.

### Mixed-State Stabilizer Rank Simulator

  - Introduced in *Quantifying quantum speedups: improved classical simulation from tighter magic monotones* ([seddon2021quantifying](@cite))
- **Improvements**:
  - Generalized BG-sampling algorithm to include mixed states.
  - Improved run-time dependence on error tolerance for approximate sampling.

#### **Mixed-State Extent**:

- **Definition**: Quantity governing run-time for mixed-state simulators.
- **Comparison**: For $n$-qubit product states, dyadic negativity, stabilizer extent, and mixed-state extent are equivalent.
