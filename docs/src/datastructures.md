## [Choosing Appropriate Tableau Data Structure](@id Choosing-Appropriate-Data-Structure)

There are four different data structures used to represent stabilizer states. If
you will never need projective measurements you probably would want to use
[`Stabilizer`](@ref). If you require projective measurements, but only on pure
states, [`Destabilizer`](@ref) should be the appropriate data structure. If
mixed stabilizer states are involved, [`MixedStabilizer`](@ref) would be
necessary.

[`Stabilizer`](@ref) is simply a list of Pauli operators in a tableau form. As a
data structure it does not enforce the requirements for a pure stabilizer state
(the rows of the tableau do not necessarily commute, nor are they forced to be
Hermitian; the tableau might be underdetermined, redundant, or contradictory).
It is up to the user to ensure that the initial values in the tableau are
meaningful and consistent.

[`canonicalize!`](@ref), [`project!`](@ref), and [`generate!`](@ref) can accept
an under determined (mixed state) `Stabilizer` instance and operate correctly.
`canonicalize!` can also accept a redundant `Stabilizer` (i.e. not all rows are
independent), leaving as many identity rows at the bottom of the canonicalized
tableau as the number of redundant stabilizers in the initial tableau.

`canonicalize!` takes ``\mathcal{O}(n^3)`` steps. `generate!` expects a
canonicalized input and then takes ``\mathcal{O}(n^2)`` steps. `project!` takes
``\mathcal{O}(n^3)`` for projecting on commuting operators due to the need to
call `canonicalize!` and `generate!`. If the projections is on an anticommuting
operator (or if `keep_result=false`) then it takes ``\mathcal{O}(n^2)`` steps.

[`MixedStabilizer`](@ref) provides explicit tracking of the rank of the mixed
state and works properly when the projection is on a commuting operator not in
the stabilizer (see table below for details). Otherwise it has the same
performance as `Stabilizer`.

The canonicalization can be made unnecessary if we track the destabilizer
generators. There are two data structures capable of that.

[`Destabilizer`](@ref) stores both the destabilizer and stabilizer states.
`project!` called on it never requires a stabilizer canonicalization, hence it
runs in ``\mathcal{O}(n^2)``. However, `project!` will raise an exception if you
try to project on a commuting state that is not in the stabilizer as that would
be an expensive ``\mathcal{O}(n^3)`` operation.

[`MixedDestabilizer`](@ref) tracks both the destabilizer operators and the
logical operators in addition to the stabilizer generators. It does not require
canonicalization for measurements and its `project!` operations always takes
``\mathcal{O}(n^2)``.

For the operation `_, anticom_index, result = project!(...)` we have the following behavior:

| projection | [`Stabilizer`](@ref) | [`MixedStabilizer`](@ref) | [`Destabilizer`](@ref) | [`MixedDestabilizer`](@ref) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| on anticommuting operator `anticom_index>0` `result===nothing`| correct result in ``\mathcal{O}(n^2)`` steps | same as `Stabilizer` | same as `Stabilizer` | same as `Stabilizer` |
| on commuting operator in the stabilizer `anticom_index==0` `result!==nothing`| ``\mathcal{O}(n^3)``; or ``\mathcal{O}(n^2)`` if `keep_result=false` | ``\mathcal{O}(n^3)`` | ``\mathcal{O}(n^2)`` if the state is pure, throws exception otherwise | ``\mathcal{O}(n^2)`` |
| on commuting operator out of the stabilizer[^1]  `anticom_index==rank` `result===nothing`| ``\mathcal{O}(n^3)``, but the user needs to manually include the new operator to the stabilizer; or ``\mathcal{O}(n^2)`` if `keep_result=false` but then result indistinguishable from cell above and `anticom_index==0` | ``\mathcal{O}(n^3)`` and rank goes up by one | not applicable if the state is pure, throws exception otherwise | ``\mathcal{O}(n^2)`` and rank goes up by one |

Notice the results when the projection operator commutes with the state but is not generated by the stabilizers of the state (the last row of the table). In that case we have `_, anticom_index, result = project!(...)` where both `anticom_index==rank` and `result===nothing`, with `rank` being the new rank after projection, one more than the number of rows in the tableau before the measurement. 

[^1]:

    This can occur only if the state being projected is mixed. Both `Stabilizer`
    and `Destabilizer` can be used for mixed states by simply providing fewer
    stabilizer generators than qubits at initialization. This can be useful for
    low-level code that tries to avoid the extra memory cost of using
    `MixedStabilizer` and `MixedDestabilizer` but should be avoided otherwise.
    `project!` works correctly or raises an explicit warning on all 4 data
    structures.

## [Bit Packing in Integers and Array Order](@id Bit-Packing-in-Integers-and-Array-Order)

We do not use boolean arrays to store information about the qubits as this would be wasteful (7 out of 8 bits in the boolean would be unused). Instead, we use all 8 qubits in a byte and perform bitwise logical operations as necessary. Implementation details of the object in RAM can matter for performance. The library permits any of the standard `UInt` types to be used for packing the bits, and larger `UInt` types (like `UInt64`) are usually faster as they permit working on 64 qubits at a time (instead of 1 if we used a boolean, or 8 if we used a byte).

Moreover, how a tableau is stored in memory can affect performance. Rows in a tabluea represent Pauli strings (e.g. the stabilizers of a stabilizer state) and each column correspond to the support of each Pauli string on a specific qubit. Accordingly, a row-major storage 
usually permits more efficient use of the CPU cache for functions that need to access and manipulate the entire Pauli string, e.g.  [`canonicalize!`](@ref) while a column-major storage benefits functions that need to access only few qubits, e.g. application of small sparse gates like [`sCNOT`](@ref). Internally, the tablueux are stored in the row-major format[^2]. One may use [`fastrow`](@ref) and [`fastcolumn`](@ref) to store a tabluea in the row-major and column-major format respectively. These functions only alter the internal storage of a tabluea and thus do not change the interface to the rest of the library. Curently they work with `Stabilizer`, `Destabilizer`, `MixedStabilizer` and `MixedDestabilizer`.

[^2]: Since the Julia language stores multidimensional arrays in a column-major format, this means that each row of the tabluea is internally stored as a column of a matrix.

Both of these parameters are [benchmarked](bench_intsize.png) (testing the application of a Pauli operator, which is an $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ operation; and testing the canonicalization of a Stabilizer, which is an $\mathcal{O}(n^3)$ operation). Row-major UInt64 is the best performing and it is  used by default in this library.
