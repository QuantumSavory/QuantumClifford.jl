## States

Stabilizer states can be represented with the [`Stabilizer`](@ref), [`Destabilizer`](@ref), [`MixedStabilizer`](@ref), and [`MixedDestabilizer`](@ref) tableau data structures. You probably want to use [`MixedDestabilizer`](@ref) which supports the widest set of operations.

Moreover, a [`MixedDestabilizer`](@ref) can be stored inside a [`Register`](@ref) together with a set of classical bits in which measurement results can be written.

Lastly, for Pauli frame simulations there is the [`PauliFrame`](@ref) type, a tableau in which each row represents a different Pauli frame.

There are [convenience constructors for common types of states and operators](@ref Useful-States-and-Operators).

## Operations

Acting on quantum states can be performed either:

- In a "linear algebra" language where unitaries, measurements, and other operations have separate interfaces. This is an explicitly deterministic lower-level interface, which provides a great deal of control over how tableaux are manipulated. See the [Stabilizer Tableau Algebra Manual](@ref Stabilizer-Tableau-Algebra-Manual) as a primer on these approaches.
- Or in a "circuit" language, where the operators (and measurements and noise) are represented as circuit gates. This is a higher-level interface in which the outcome of an operation can be stochastic. The API for it is centered around the `apply!` function. Particularly useful for [Monte Carlo simulations](@ref noisycircuits_mc) and [Perturbative Expansion Symbolic Results](@ref noisycircuits_perturb).

See the [full list of operations](@ref all-operations) for a list of implemented operations.
